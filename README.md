# AT-Y-SPEC-MATE-Re-Creation

Back in the heyday of the Sinclair Spectrum and other 8-bit computers that kick started the home computing movement, I owned a Sinclair Spectrum 48K Plus that I upgraded from my original rubber key Spectrum with a kit from Sinclair. Along with my friends help, I used to hack games for infinite lives etc. This was a very common practice made easier by certian interfaces. The interfaces would freeze the game/program you were running and allow it to be saved to some sort of media, Tape, Sinclairâ€™s own Microdrive or floppy disc for example.

Of course, these interfaces were quite expensive and above the budget of your average schoolboy hacker! I used to hack long-hand, that is to say, from the loader up. Some programs defeated my limited knowledge. Handily though, I had a friend who was into computers and had a more affluent family than I. He got a SPEC-MATE for his birthday. Later on, he loaned it to me so I could capture my game collection to Tape/Microdrive. This was a revelation! And one of the really useful features was that the SPEC-MATE made two files of main memory. This meant that you could load a dissassembler into one part of memory and a half of the programs code in the other. Hacking became exponentially easier!
